# Working with Stripe Data and R

I recently started working with [R](http://www.r-project.org/ "The R Project for Statistical Computing"). As we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as one of our payment providers, I thought it might be interesting to use Stripe's CSV files and R to answer some of the questions every SaaS startup needs to know.


## How many new, recurring and lost users do we have per week?
As we have a weekly meeting where we discuss our numbers, it would be best to get the numbers per week. So I decided to start with the question of how many new and recurring customer we have, as well as how many customers we loose per week.

To start I only wanted to have a table that shows the week and below the numbers for lost, new and recurring customers.
In future posts, I plan to show different aspects like financial data or add visual features like plots. 



## The CSV file from Stripe
If you are a Stripe user you can download the payments.csv file directly from [https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments). 

```r
> names(raw_data)
 [1] "id"                         "Description"               
 [3] "Created..UTC."              "Amount"                    
 [5] "Amount.Refunded"            "Currency"                  
 [7] "Converted.Amount"           "Converted.Amount.Refunded" 
 [9] "Fee"                        "Tax"                       
[11] "Converted.Currency"         "Mode"
