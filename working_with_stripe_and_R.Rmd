# Working with Stripe Data and R

I recently started working with [R](http://www.r-project.org/ "The R Project for Statistical Computing"). As we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as one of our payment providers, I thought it might be interesting to use Stripe's CSV files and R to answer some of the questions every SaaS startup needs to know.


## How many new, recurring and lost users do we have per week?
As we have a weekly meeting where we discuss our numbers, it would be best to get the numbers per week. So I decided to start with the question of how many new, recurring we have as well as how many customers we definitely lost.
