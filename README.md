## Question: We use Stripe. How many new, recurring and lost customers do we have per week?
In the article [Working with Stripe Data and R] (https://github.com/rogerfischer/stripe_with_R/blob/master/working_with_stripe_and_R.Rmd) we explain how to answer this question by using [R](http://www.r-project.org/ "The R Project for Statistical Computing").

## The article explaining the script
Read the article [Working with Stripe Data and R] (https://github.com/rogerfischer/stripe_with_R/blob/master/working_with_stripe_and_R.Rmd) along with the [R Script "stripe_weekly_new_recurring_lost.R"](https://github.com/rogerfischer/stripe_with_R/blob/master/stripe_weekly_new_recurring_lost.R).

My hope is that even people with no prior knowledge of R can find the script useful and work with it.

Prerequisites
- Installed R
- Installed R Studio (optional)
- payments.csv file from [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)
- [R Script "stripe_weekly_new_recurring_lost.R"](https://github.com/rogerfischer/stripe_with_R/blob/master/stripe_weekly_new_recurring_lost.R)
